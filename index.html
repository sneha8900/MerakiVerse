        <h2 class="two ">What does Meraki mean?</h2>
        <h3>This is a word that modern Greeks often use to desribe doing something<br> with soul, creativity or love - when you put "something of yourself " <br>into what you're doing, whatever it may be.</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="three ">What is Mandala?</h2>
        <h3>Mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. <br>The circular designs symbolizes the idea that life is never ending and everything is connected. <br>The mandala also represents spiritual journey within
            the individual viewer. The first level is <br>understanding the unity in cosmos and the second level is that each individual must find <br>their own place within it. Mandala designs are meant to remove irritating thoughts<br> and allow the creative mind
            to run free as well as relaxation. But ultimately <br>people create and look at mandalas to centre the body and mind.</h3>
        <h2 class="four ">So what you waiting for? Grab the art work that you love!!</h2>
